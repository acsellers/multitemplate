3 steps

1: Scan (78 lines)
  Takes in the raw string of the template and turns it into the tree form
  that we'll need. We don't care whether you prefer tabs or spaces here.

2: Tokenize (the big code)
  Takes in the tree created by scan and turns it into a tree of tokens.
  Note that some lines are ambiguous without more information, so we'll
  need to add in a parameter to push in the html elements and template
  functions to reduce the abiguity.

3: Compile 
  Takes the tree output from tokenize and add in some minor processing
  like function auto-closes and outputs a text/template/parse tree.
