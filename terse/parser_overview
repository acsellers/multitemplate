3 steps

1: Scan (78 lines)
  Takes in the raw string of the template and turns it into the tree form
  that we'll need. We don't care whether you prefer tabs or spaces here.

2: Tokenize (main logic)
  Takes in the tree created by scan and turns it into a tree of tokens.
  Tokens either have content, or they have opening tokens, closing tokens,
  children tokens. All tokens have a type, which is used by compile.

3: Compile (minor logic)
  Takes the tree of tokens from Tokenize, then runs some simple rules to 
  turn it into a parse.Tree.
